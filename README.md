Case Study of Switzerland During COVID-19

Using data updated daily from ECDC's website, we take a look at the number of cases and deaths for countries within the dataset. We then focus on Switzerland's data. Note that the data and the file is updated daily whenever I run my computer.

### What This Notebook Shows:
1. General review and use of Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Styling
2. Use of Markdown on Jupyter Notebook
3. Analyzing COVID-19's spreading rate in Switzerland
4. Possible ideas for future related projects

__Note 1: The first notebook had two parts: International and Switzerland's Case Study. In a new notebook, I have isolated the Swiss Case Study analysis to make it simpler for the reader.__

__Note 2: There are some data quality issues made by the providers as the number of cases of cases and deaths for many countries reported are wrongly inputted. On April 15th 2020, we started to have this issue for only one row: the international conveyance of Japan with -9 cases. On September 3rd 2020, we had 15+ countries with this issue.__

__Note 3: Conclusion Written Before November 1st (Quarantine Announced in Switzerland)__ 

Regarding COVID, some people question if the virus is a real threat (whether there should be a quarantine in Switzerland) anymore when we look at the number of deaths vs the number of cases. Many "experts" do not understand the real meaning behind statistics as we are highly connected today and that the contamination factor is not linear but in fact quite exponential/non-linear. Much of these statistics above are hence quite meaningless on top of the data quality not being great either (to follow up on data quality, it would be good to have the number of tests administered, the recontamination factor percentage and many more useful information).

Anyone who really understands Black Swan (extremely random, rare and extreme) events such as pandemics will not take the situation lightly by just looking at these simple numbers. Then, comes the question of ethics (be a darwinist or try to save everyone). The fact that idiotic governments took such bad decisions since the beginning of the spread in February and the way the virus has been dealt since is just a clear lack of leadership and understanding. Let's even look at the bigger picture: the economy will be blamed on this virus when most of it was already broken since 2008. Small businesses are being forced to close down and big companies will get bailouts. However, I do not believe it is sustainable and I suggest you, the reader, to invest in agriculture to become antifragile.
