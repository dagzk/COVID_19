Case Study of Switzerland During COVID-19

__Note May 18th 2020:__ There are some data quality issues made by the providers as the number of cases of cases and deaths reported are wrongly inputted. On April 15th 2020, we had this same issue for only one country: the international conveyance of Japan with -9 cases. I have not modified the code related to the world stats in the first part as those issues did not affect my analysis, which is mainly centered on Switzerland.
