Case Study of Switzerland During COVID-19

__Note September 16th 2020:__ There are some data quality issues made by the providers as the number of cases of cases and deaths reported are wrongly inputted. On April 15th 2020, we had started to have this issue for only one row: the international conveyance of Japan with -9 cases. On September 3rd 2020, we have 16 countries with this issue. I have partially modified the code related to the world stats in the first part as those issues did affect some analysis. Nevertheless, the analysis part that is centered on Switzerland is still intact.
