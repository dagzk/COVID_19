Case Study of Switzerland During COVID-19

Using data updated daily from ECDC's website, we take a look at the number of cases and deaths for countries within the dataset. We then focus on Switzerland's data. Note that the data is updated daily.

### What This Notebook Shows:
1. General review and use of Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Styling
2. Use of Markdown on Jupyter Notebook
3. Analyzing COVID-19's spreading rate in Switzerland
4. Possible ideas for future related projects

__Note 1: The first notebook had two parts: International and Switzerland's Case Study. In a new notebook, I have isolated the Swiss Case Study analysis to make it simpler for the reader.__

__Note 2: There are some data quality issues made by the providers as the number of cases of cases and deaths for many countries reported are wrongly inputted. On April 15th 2020, we started to have this issue for only one row: the international conveyance of Japan with -9 cases. On September 3rd 2020, we had 15+ countries with this issue.__
